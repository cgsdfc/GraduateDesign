# Meta Info
- Title: ∆BLEU: A Discriminative Metric for Generation Tasks with Intrinsically Diverse Targets
- Galley 2015
- Delta BLEU, Discriminative BLEU.

# Contribution
- In tasks involving generation of conversational
responses, ∆BLEU correlates reasonably with human judgments.
- and outperforms sentence-level and IBM BLEU in terms of both Spearman’s ρ and Kendall’s τ .

# Motivation
Many natural language processing tasks involve
the generation of texts where a variety of outputs
are acceptable or even desirable.

**Every time they mention BLEU they also mention METEOR.**

# Criticism of BLEU
[Callison-Burch](../../bib_db/metric/ReEvalBLEU.bib) Re-evaluate the role of BLEU.

# Supporters of BLEU
BLEU scores have been shown to correlate well with human judgements by:
- [Doddington 2002](../../bib_db/metric/Doddington2002_NIST.bib) the author of NIST-BLEU.
