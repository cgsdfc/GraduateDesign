\textbf{消息：}&Hmm ... My question went unnanswered for a while . Here 's what I asked : How would I ssh to a computer that is located remotely ? Say the remote IP was **unknown** . 9.9 , and the internal IP of the computer was 192.168 . 1.12 , how would I ssh to it ? \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ your question is not clear {-} did you mean that your remote host is behind a router ( with the external address **unknown** . 9.9 ) ? \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ yes \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ in that case follow what bekks said {-} you need to tell the router to forward traffic to the server \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ k \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_\\%

\textbf{消息：}&looks like a bunch of people are having the problem with nouveau crashing if I understood your issue , http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2065876\&page=2 sounds similar and suggests using nomodeset and then installing the proprietary nvidia drivers \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ I have been trying that , along with disabling splash , trism . The problem is that terminal doesn't start up properly when trying to boot after installed . \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ with nomodeset ? \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ Yes , trism . \_\_eou\_\_ It 's my little brother 's black box that some how manages to run .

I will go through the bug list and see how they fixed it . \_\_eou\_\_ Bug 1043518 is exactly the problem I am having . I am going through the list to see what their work around is . \_\_eou\_\_ I am also running the 32bit Ubuntu 12.10 , not the 64 . \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ I did notice the bug earlier , though I didn't mention it because it is supposed to be fixed in the kernel in 12.10 when it was released ( though reading the comments now other people are still having problems ) \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ Ideas ? \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ not really sure unfortunately , if you could ctrl+alt+f1 or f2 , I would try installing nvidia{-}current ( plus the linux{-}headers if they aren't already installed ) and see if you can boot \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ I am unable to open terminal , trism . I get the \_ and no input gets put in . Either with CAf1 or f2 . \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ do you know what nvidia card you have ? \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ 7800GT \_\_eou\_\_ That , unfortuantely , is not a typo . \_\_eou\_\_ ' Wanna buy bank logins'? No ! It 's ' Vendor buy the bank guards **unknown** \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ I'll see if I notice anything , but unfortunately I am kind of out of ideas ... did you try the recovery option in grub ? \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ I did not . \_\_eou\_\_ how do I get to that from start up ? \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ from grub select the Advanced Options item , which should take you to other kernels , one of them says ( recovery mode ) \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ How do I pull up the Grub ? \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_\\%
\textbf{参考：}&how did you add nomodeset without getting to grub ? \_\_eou\_\_\\%
