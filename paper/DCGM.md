- title: A neural network approach to context-sensitive generation of conversation responses
- author: Sordoni

# Contribution
- train end-to-end on unstructured Twitter data.
- using NN to address sparsity problem when integrating context.
- dynamic-context generative model.
- data-driven.

**First Application of a neural network model to open-domain response generation.**

- a multi-reference extraction technique that shows promise for 
automated evaluation. (Metrics)

# Background
- vast quantities of conversational exchanges become available on social media
such as Twitter and Reddit, giving rise to data-driven models.

# Related Works
- [Ritter 2011](../bib_db/model/ritter/Ritter2011.bib) constructs a statistical machine translation system  from Twitter Corpus to generate response from a status post.
- Drawback: responses are *not* sensitive to context. (not context-sensitive)

# What is a context
- Linguistic context, *not* physical one.
- past utterances.
- encoded in a continuous context vector.

# Benefits
- Context is important: 
    * the ability to take into account previous utterances is key to building dialog systems that can keep conversations active and engaging.
- Embedding-based model:
    * model the transition between consecutive utterances.
    * capture long-span dependency.
- Robustness to sparsity:
    * capture context info while avoiding unmanageable growth of model parameters.
   
# Challenges
- Context info is hard for the MT model to capture.
- Naive injection of context is unmanageable due to data sparsity.

# Solutions
- Using embeddings for words and phrases. (Benefits of Word Embeddings)
    * compactly encode semantic and syntactic similarity.
    * address the sparsity problem.

# Models
- simple, context-sensitive, response-generation models.
- first encode past info into continuous representation and then decode it using RLM.
- completely data-driven.
- no human annotation is needed.
- As opposed to: typical complex task-oriented multi-modular dialog system.

   
*a line of though:* Although the training is nearly free of human annotation, the evaluation of such system relies heavily on human evaluation. The training of task-oriented system relies on human annotation but its evaluation is more supervised. One cannot gain both sides of goodness.

## Recurrent Language Model (RLM)
- benefits of using an RLM:
    * plausible
    * fluent
    * contextual relevant

* requires human annotation.
* task-oriented.
* complex.

## Radical paradigm shift
- Accomplish both task jointly.
- latent dialog state.
- optimize directly to end-to-end performance.
- data-driven.

## Traditional Dialog System
- tease apart dialog management from response generation. (Young, Stent).
- hand-coded many components.
- labels and attributes defining dialog states.

## Previous uses of ML
- response generation, [Walker 2003]()
- dialog state tracking,[Young 2010]()
- user modeling, [Georgila 2006]()

## Context Vector
- learnt along with the RLM that generates the responses.
- as opposed to [Mikolov 2012](../bib_db/classic/mikolov/MikolovZ12.bib), which uses a pre-trained topic model.
- do not exclude stopwords.
- stopwords carry discriminative power like `how are you?` are all stopwords.


# Overview
## RNNLM
*note:* the RNNLM described here seems not to use LSTM.

```latex
Given sentences $s=s_1,\cdots,s_T$, the model estimates:
\begin{align}
    p(s) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} p(s_t|s_1,\cdots,s_{t-1})
\end{align}
The model is parametrized by 3 matrices
$\Theta_{RNN}=\left< W_{in}, W_{out}, W_{hh} \right> $.
Input $s_t$ is a one-hot vector for a word in the vocabulary.
It is projected to its embedding by the input matrix $W_{in} \in \mathcal{R}^{V \times K}$ via $s_t^T W_{in}$.
The recurrent matrix $W_{hh} \in \mathcal{R}^{K \times K}$ keeps track of the history of the seen words.

The output matrix $W_{out} \in \mathcal{R}^{K\times K}$ projects the hidden state to an output layer
$o_t$, which is used to generate a probability for each word.

The forward pass is:
\begin{align}
    h_t = \sigma \left( s_t^T W_{in} + h_{t-1}^T W_{hh} \right), o_t = h_t^T W_{out}
\end{align}

Apparently this does not make use of any gating like LSTM or GRU.
It is the most basic (naive) form of RNN -- only a linear layer plus a sigmod activation is used. Won't it suffer from gradient vanishing or exploring?
?

$K$ is th$K$ is the vector dimension.
$V$ is the vocab size.
There is no hidden layer size.
The recurrence seed is $h_0 = 0$, the zero vector.
aThe probability of the next word is obtained by:
\begin{align}
    P(s_t = w|s_1,\cdots,s_{t-1}=\frac{\exp(o_{tw})}{\sum_{v=1}^{V}\exp(o_{tv})})
\end{align}
cThe objective function is:
\begin{align}
    L(s) = -\sum_{t=1}^{T}\log P(s_t = w|s_1,\cdots,s_{t-1})
\end{align}
tThis is the \textbf{negative log likehood of the training sentence s}
```

The backward pass is *unrolled backwards in time* using
the _back-propagation through time_ (BPTT) algorithm.
(This may be in common use for training RNN).
Gradients are accumulated over multiple time-steps.
