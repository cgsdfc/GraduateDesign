    abstract = "This paper describes a new evaluation metric, TER-Plus (TERp) for automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT). TERp is an extension of Translation Edit Rate (TER). It builds on the success of TER as an evaluation metric and alignment tool and addresses several of its weaknesses through the use of paraphrases, stemming, synonyms, as well as edit costs that can be automatically optimized to correlate better with various types of human judgments. We present a correlation study comparing TERp to BLEU, METEOR and TER, and illustrate that TERp can better evaluate translation adequacy.",
