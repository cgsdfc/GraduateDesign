\textbf{消息：}&It turns out the HDD enclosure I bought , doesn't work with ubuntu and will ruin hard drive partitions when it is mounted . Does anybody know of a good hdd enclosure that works with linux ? \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ weird .. ive nevere seen one NOT work reguardless of os . \_\_eou\_\_ and ive used dozens of them over the years \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_ my partitions will get created by gparted , and then if I unmount and mount again , they are gone . \_\_eou\_\_ it works fine in windows and the drive never had a problem before I put it in the enclosure . \_\_eou\_\_ \_\_eot\_\_\\%
\textbf{参考：}&err .. you do use the ' **unknown** changes ' button ? ;) \_\_eou\_\_\\%
\textbf{响应：}&get the gparted live cd and mount the windows files over that and see what happens . I guess that typically lots of data went wrong with the ntfs data that ive used . i recall a similer feature org issue with 11 beta versions in them . it came ON 8.10 wanting to make a working one . i ran a new hard drive and had some issues . 4 days , i fixed the fancy stuff like ' copying xp ' to some forums .. \_\_eou\_\_\\%

\textbf{参考：}&watchdog ? \_\_eou\_\_ watchdog is just what the manpage says => it 's kind of a " dead man switch ", cheap version . ( Basically , as long the user space watch dog process runs often enough to service the /dev/watchdog device , the kernel considers everything okay , as in " even if it 's bad , it will fix itself ", while if the watchdog user space process dies , it considers the system fucked up enough that will hard reset the box . \_\_eou\_\_\\%
\textbf{响应：}&better maybe it 's not worth compiling , but I don't compile a linux distribution on it , which there are no problems with the kernel source package , but it 's easier explaining the info , seeing what you're trying to do , but only by following this >> distros nvidia kernel source kernel 2.6 \_\_eou\_\_\\%
